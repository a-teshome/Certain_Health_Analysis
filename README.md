### Stakeholder Request
The leaderdership team requested a dasboard to support quarterly business reviews and strategic marketing decisions at SureHealth by providing a comprehensive, interactive view of the to-date impact of marketing campaign categories launched in 2019. Specifically, the dashboard should address:
- **Marketing and signup performance**: Display values for key metrics such as impressions, clicks, click-through-rates, signups, and signup rates, across campaigns.
- **Campaign effectiveness**: Compare marketing spend, signups, and subsequent claim behavior across campaign categories.
- **Trend analysis**: Visualize signups and claim amounts over time, with filters for campaign category, plan type, state, and campaign topic.
- **Category comparison**: Support side-by-side comparison of performance across campaign types.
The dashboard is intended to enable the marketing team to independently access, explore, and interpret campaign data in support of ongoing reporting and strategic planning.
